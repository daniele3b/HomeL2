as the owner of the property located in $street$, which you rented
under the contract signed in $day$ data, I note that today it is not
yet available to pay the amount of € $cash$ you paid title of rent and
expenses with reference to the months of December.

The invitation, therefore, to pay the amount of € $cash$, no later
than 10 days from the receipt of this letter, informing you that, in the
absence of payment within the aforementioned term, you will be forced to
take legal action in your comparisons, without notice, also by means of
an eviction procedure for arrears, with the charge of expenses and any
further charges borne exclusively by him.

This is valid for all legal purposes, including as formal formal notice.

With best regards
