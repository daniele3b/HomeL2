Dear $to$
Parramatta Local Court, Case number 2011/000012
Your ref: BAL12345
I refer to your letter dated 10 October 2011.

I deny that I owe your client any money at all. I hired your client to do gardening work at my property, but your client failed to do any of the work agreed upon, and in fact did not do any work on my property at all.
As a result, I had to hire another gardener to do the work your client had originally agreed to do. I enclose a receipt for the gardening work performed by the other gardener.â€‹

I ask that your client file a Notice of Discontinuance and that a copy of the sealed Notice of Discontinuance be served on me within 7 days of the date of this letter.

Yours faithfully,
